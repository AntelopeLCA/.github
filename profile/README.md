# Antelope LCA Framework
A framework for distributed computation of LCA results.

## Separation of Concerns

Simplify the data challenges of LCA by breaking big problems into small ones
 - **xdb** - exchange database - stores background LCI from published data sources
 - **qdb** - quantity database - flow characteristics, hazard traits, properties, LCIA, and regionalization
 - **oryx** - model runner - share product models and computation results

## The shared model is the source of meaning

Use Antelope software to host a [data-free model](data-free-model.pdf) to describe your study and system boundary

## Designed for EPD

Construct *consistent* and *comparable* EPDs using shared models.

## Open source

Use [antelope.py](https://github.com/AntelopeLCA/antelope) to compute with free data today!
